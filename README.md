This is ultimately the most fun lab that has ever been created in MEET history!

#### Question: Requirements? </br>
### Answer: Y1: None! Y2: As long as it's deployed on Heroku.
< /br></br>
#### Question: What to do?</br>
### Answer: To pick one staff member only (from your hub), and create a website about him/her.
</br></br>
#### Question: Your Challenge?</br>
### Answer: To try and collect as much information as possible about the staff member without using his/her help! And showing it on the website obviously. (Of course, without disrespecting any member or not sticking to the meet values!)
